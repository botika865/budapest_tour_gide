The Art Gallery was founded in 1877 on the initiative of the Hungarian National Fine Arts. <br>
The original building was situated at 69-71 Andrássy Street, now home to the University of Fine Arts. <br>
The exhibition hall on Heroes' Square was erected in 1896 for the millennium celebrations, and was designed by Albert Schikedanz. <br>
Today the hall operates on the pattern of the German Kunsthalle: it is an institution run by artists that does not maintain its own collection. <br>
The three-bayed, semi-circular apse houses a roofed exhibition hall that allows in light through the roof.<br>
Since the building was renovated in 1995 the Art Gallery has welcomed visitors and leading Hungarian and international contemporary artists <br>
alike, mediating and representing modern artistic tendencies whilst not maintaining its own permanent collection.<br>
