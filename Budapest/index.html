    <strong>Budapest</strong> is the capital  and most populous city of Hungary. It is the ninth-largest city in the European Union by population within city<br>
    limits and the largest city on the Danube river; the city has an estimated population of 1,752,286 over a land area of about<br>
    525 square kilometres (203 square miles). Budapest, which is both a city and county, forms the centre of the Budapest metropolitan<br>
    area, which has an area of <strong> 7,626 square kilometres</strong> (2,944 square miles) and a population of 3,303,786. It is a primate city,<br>
    constituting 33% of the population of Hungary. <br>
    <br>

    The history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum, the capital of<br>
    Lower Pannonia. The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century, but the area was pillaged by the Mongols<br>
    in 1241-42. Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century.<br>
    The Battle of Mohács, in 1526, was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule. After the reconquest of Buda in 1686,<br>
    the region entered a new age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda, Óbuda and Pest<br>
    on 17 November 1873, with the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital. Budapest also became the co-capital of the<br>
    Austro-Hungarian Empire, a great power that dissolved in 1918, following World War I. The city was the focal point of<br>
    the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the Battle of Budapest in 1945, as well as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. <br>
    <br>

    Budapest is a global city with strengths in commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment.<br>
    Hungary's financial centre, Budapest is also the headquarters of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology,<br>
    the European Police College and the first foreign office of the China Investment Promotion Agency.<br>
    Over 40 colleges and universities are located in Budapest, including Eötvös Loránd University, Corvinus University,<br>
    Semmelweis University, University of Veterinary Medicine Budapest and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.<br>
    Opened in 1896, the city's subway system, the Budapest Metro, serves 1.27 million,<br>
    while the Budapest Tram Network serves 1.08 million passengers daily.<br>
