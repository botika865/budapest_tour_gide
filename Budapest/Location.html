    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Budapest/@47.4813274,18.9654954,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x4741c334d1d4cfc9:0x400c4290c1e1160!8m2!3d47.497912!4d19.040235!16zL20vMDk1d18?entry=ttu">Budapest</a>, strategically placed at the centre of the Pannonian Basin, lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia <br>
    with the Great Plain. By road it is 216 kilometres (134 mi) south-east of Vienna, 545 kilometres (339 mi) south of Warsaw, <br>
    1,565 kilometres (972 mi) south-west of Moscow, 1,122 kilometres (697 mi) north of Athens, 1,235 kilometres (767 mi) <br>
    north-east of Rome, 788 kilometres (490 mi) north-east of Milan, 443 kilometres (275 mi) south-east of Prague, 343 kilometres <br>
    (213 mi) north-east of Zagreb, 748 kilometres (465 mi) north-east of Split and 1,329 kilometres (826 mi) north-west of Istanbul.

    The wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. <br>
    The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, <br>
    while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river's opposite bank. <br>
    Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude 
    as Buda's smallest hills, notably Gellért Hill and Castle Hill.

<h1>Climate</h1>

<p>
    Budapest has a humid temperate climate (Köppen: Cfa, Trewartha: Doa) with warm to hot summers and chilly winters. <br>
    Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. <br>
    Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of -10 °C (14 °F) <br>
    are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. <br>
    The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. <br>
    The weather in late March and in April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. <br>
    Budapest's long summer  lasting from May until mid-September  is warm or very warm. <br>
    Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. <br>
    The autumn in Budapest (mid-September until late October) <br>
    is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. <br>
    Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October or early November.
