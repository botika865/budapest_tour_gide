  <h2>Buda Castle</h2>
    <p>
    Crowning the capital atop Castle Hill, Buda Castle presents an architectural melting pot, <br>
    with Renaissance ruins around the foundations, a grand Habsburg-era neoclassical façade, and a stark communist-style interior. <br>
    The palace is divided into three museums: The Hungarian National Gallery, the Budapest History Museum and the National Széchényi Library. <br>
    You could easily spend the whole day just mooching around these three. <br>
    But make sure to bring a camera the views over the river and cobbled courtyards are quite something.

<h2>Széchenyi Baths</h2> 
<p>
Take a plunge in Budapest's most famous thermal bath. <br>
The Széchenyi Baths are a visual feast with their canary-hued colonnades and steaming outdoor thermal pools. <br> <img src="bath.webp" alt="bath" class="castle">
Make sure you go inside to explore the vast interior clad with ceramics, marble and mosaics. <br>
Budapest is known as the 'City of Spas' for its 120 geothermal springs so don't miss out.

<br>
<h2>Hungarian Parliament</h2> 
<p>
Another Danube-side icon, the Hungarian Parliament dominates the Pest side of the river with its neo-gothic spires, <br>
gargoyles and a dome that peaks at 97 metres. Tour the building, see it from a boat or simply look over from Buda.  <br>
If you take a guided tour, climb the golden staircase, and ogle the crown jewels that once belonged to Hungary's first king (plus the rooms where the Hungarian government now meet).
